# Support Mansour's Portal: The Resilient Bloom

## The Story

In 2019, a 10-year-old girl named **Sara Mansour** painted a flower in Norrköping, Sweden. She gifted it to her grandmother in Cairo, Egypt. The painting then traveled to Gaza, where it survived 5 years of hardship alongside the family.

Today, this painting remains enshrined in grandmother's room in Cairo. We choose NOT to move it.

**The Resilient Bloom** is a Legacy NFT that immortalizes this journey on the Solana blockchain - a digital soul that travels the world while the physical canvas stays home.

## What Makes This Special

- **Dynamic NFT**: The artwork's "aura" changes based on Cairo timezone, reflecting how grandmother sees it at different times of day
- **Cultural Preservation**: Using blockchain to preserve family stories across generations
- **Real Human Story**: Not speculation - this is a real painting, a real family, a real grandmother
