# Superteam Instagrant Application

## Project Name
**Mansour's Portal: The Resilient Bloom**

## One-line Description
A dynamic Legacy NFT on Solana immortalizing a 10-year-old's painting that traveled from Sweden to Gaza, with an aura that changes based on Cairo timezone.

## Category
- [x] Content / Storytelling
- [x] NFT / Digital Art
- [x] Cultural Preservation

## Funding Request
**$250 USD** (approximately 2 SOL for Solana Mainnet deployment)

## Problem Statement
Family stories and artwork are lost across generations. Traditional methods of preservation (photos, physical storage) are fragile. Blockchain offers permanence, but deployment costs create barriers for meaningful cultural projects.

## Solution
**The Resilient Bloom** is:
1. A **real painting** by Sara Mansour (age 10) that traveled from Sweden to Cairo to Gaza
2. A **dynamic NFT** whose visual "aura" changes based on Cairo timezone (where grandmother lives)
3. A **smart contract** preserving the painting's metadata and journey immutably
4. An **open-source example** of using NFTs for family legacy preservation

## What's Already Built (100% Complete)
- Anchor/Rust smart contract deployed on Devnet
- Metaplex NFT minted with full metadata
- Image and metadata stored on IPFS
- Next.js frontend with wallet integration
- Dynamic aura system (4 time-based visual states)

**Live Demo**: [Devnet Deployment]
**GitHub**: https://github.com/abdulwahed-sweden/mansour-portal-legacy

## What Funding Enables
Mainnet deployment only. The project is complete - we just need deployment costs:
- Program account rent: 1.75 SOL
- Transaction fees: ~0.01 SOL
- Buffer: ~0.24 SOL

## Why Solana?
- Low transaction costs for future interactions
- Fast finality for aura updates
- Metaplex standard for NFT compatibility
- Strong community for cultural projects

## Team
**Abdulwahed Mansour**
- Full-stack developer based in Sweden
- Sara's family member (the painter)
- Building this to honor grandmother in Cairo

## Impact
1. **Immediate**: One family's story preserved forever on-chain
2. **Template**: Open-source blueprint for cultural preservation NFTs
3. **Narrative**: Shows NFTs have meaning beyond speculation

Hi Superteam UAE!

I'm Abdulwahed from Sweden, building "Mansour's Portal" - a legacy NFT preserving my family's painting that traveled from Sweden to Gaza.

The project is 100% complete on Devnet. I need ~2 SOL ($250) for Mainnet deployment.

GitHub: https://github.com/abdulwahed-sweden/mansour-portal-legacy

This is a real family story - my cousin Sara painted it at age 10, and it survived 5 years in Gaza with our grandmother.

Would love your support or guidance!
