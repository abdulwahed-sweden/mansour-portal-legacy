### Main Announcement (Thread Starter)
```
I'm building a Legacy NFT on Solana to immortalize my family's story.

My cousin Sara painted this flower at age 10 in Sweden. She gifted it to our grandmother in Cairo.

The painting then traveled to Gaza, where it survived 5 years of hardship.

Now it becomes eternal on blockchain.

### Thread Part 2
```
The painting still hangs in grandmother's room in Cairo. We chose NOT to move it.

But its digital soul? That can travel the world.

"The Resilient Bloom" is a dynamic NFT whose aura changes based on Cairo timezone - reflecting how grandmother sees it throughout the day.

```

### Thread Part 3
```
The project is 100% complete on Solana Devnet:
- Anchor smart contract deployed
- Metaplex NFT minted
- Dynamic aura system working
- Frontend live

I just need ~2 SOL for Mainnet deployment.

If you believe NFTs can preserve real human stories (not just speculation), I'd appreciate any support:

Or just a retweet helps

**Body**:

Hey Solana community,

I built a complete NFT project on Devnet and need ~2 SOL for Mainnet deployment. Let me share the story:

**The Painting**
My cousin Sara painted a flower at age 10 in Sweden. She gifted it to our grandmother who took it to Cairo, then Gaza. It survived 5 years there. The painting still hangs in grandmother's room - we chose not to move it.

**The Tech**
- Anchor/Rust smart contract with dynamic metadata
- The NFT's "aura" changes based on Cairo timezone (4 states throughout the day)
- Metaplex standard NFT
- IPFS storage via Pinata
- Next.js frontend with wallet integration

**What I Need**
Mainnet deployment costs: ~1.76 SOL for rent-exempt storage

**Links**
- GitHub: https://github.com/abdulwahed-sweden/mansour-portal-legacy
- Devnet NFT: https://explorer.solana.com/address/GdSW2Drudy2VxYb1ZtHm9AmjsvJ9artaeSRmYqTxUX8m?cluster=devnet
- Painting: https://gateway.pinata.cloud/ipfs/QmbmreB8fSVruYEGZZqdnxxyvdEyibiBp21nG84qtKca3F

Or just feedback on the code is welcome!

Thanks for reading.

**Title**: [Showcase] Dynamic Legacy NFT with time-based aura - Anchor + Metaplex + Next.js

**Body**:
```
Built a complete NFT project and wanted to share the architecture:

**Smart Contract (Anchor)**
- LegacyState PDA storing painting metadata
- Cairo timezone calculation for dynamic aura (on-chain)
- 4 aura states: Serene Dawn, Golden Radiance, Mystical Shadows, Silent Guardian
- Immutable fields for sanctuary_location and is_enshrined

**Frontend**
- Next.js with Solana wallet adapter
- Real-time aura sync with Cairo time
- Responsive design with Tailwind

**Deployment**
- Currently on Devnet (need ~2 SOL for Mainnet)
- GitHub: https://github.com/abdulwahed-sweden/mansour-portal-legacy

The backstory: It's a real painting by my 10-year-old cousin that survived 5 years in Gaza with our grandmother. Building this as a family legacy project.

Happy to answer any technical questions!

## LinkedIn Post

I'm building something meaningful with blockchain technology.

My cousin Sara painted a flower when she was 10 years old in Sweden. She gifted it to our grandmother, who took it to Cairo, and then to Gaza. The painting survived 5 years of hardship alongside our family.

Today, that painting still hangs in grandmother's room. We chose not to move it.

But I wanted its story to live forever. So I built "The Resilient Bloom" - a Legacy NFT on Solana that preserves this journey on the blockchain.

The NFT is dynamic - its visual "aura" changes based on the time in Cairo, reflecting how grandmother sees the painting throughout her day.

Technical stack:
- Rust/Anchor smart contract
- Metaplex NFT standard
- IPFS decentralized storage
- Next.js frontend

The project is complete on Solana's test network. I need approximately $250 worth of SOL for production deployment.

If you believe technology can preserve human stories, I'd appreciate any support or sharing.
